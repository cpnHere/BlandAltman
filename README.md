# BlandAltman
This repository contains a demonstration of the Bland-Altman plotting and analysis technique, which is a statistically robust yet simple alternative to regression and scatterplot methods often employed for the assessment of the 'quality' of a measurement system or data product. 

Bland-Altman analysis addresses the question *"Can measurements from an instrument/algorithm/technique/etc. replace that of another?"* Regression and scatterplots are not designed to address this question, and are based on assumptions of data numerical distribution that is often not the case many datasets. Bland-Altman metrics are also useful because they are expressed in the units of the data itself. 

This python notebook, assessed in the Google Colab link below, describes the technique and provides side by side examples of Bland-Altman and regression/scatterplot analysis. It also provides an analysis and plotting function.
